    "# Star Wars Survey\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the years, many [Star Wars movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_films) have been released, and have become incredibly popular. The first movies were Episodes IV, V and VI, together forming 'the first trilogy', followed by Episodes I, II and III (the second trilogy). While waiting for [Episode VII: The Force Awakens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Force_Awakens) to come out, the team at [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/), an American website that focuses on opinion poll analysis, politics, economics, and sports blogging, became interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. In particular, they wondered: *does the rest of America realize that 'Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back' is clearly the best of the bunch?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The team needed to collect data addressing this question. To do this, they surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey. Questions being asked included 'Which Star Wars films have you seen?' and 'Please rank the Star Wars films in your order of preference'. They received around one thousand responses, which you can download from [their GitHub repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study we will do an analysis of the responses that were collected. Not only will we answer 538's question, also we will take a deeper look at the popularity of the episodes, both in terms of rankings and in terms of how many watched them. We will also take a look till what extent that's the same for men and women alike. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with doing some initial data exploration. Then we will clean the data, including some reformatting to make analysis easier. This will be followed by the actual analysis of the cleaned data. Several graphs will show the analysis results. Main observations are below those graphs and are also summarized at the end."
